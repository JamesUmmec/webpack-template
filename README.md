# webpack template

this is a template for web development using webpack, typescript, less and jquery. just `git clone` it and run `npm i`, then you can focus on development rather than file structure config.

the template is a webpage with hello world and now time on it. you can just delete what you need not and add your own code to establish your webpage.

don't forget to change items like `name` `author` `version` and so on in the `package.json` file and add your license rather than the raw one.

fell free to use, enjoy.
